The Petra Library Manager, a simple LMS that will make it easy to manage library-related tasks. The app is available for both librarians and run-of-the-mill of students of the Petra Christian University.

### USERS
Like your typical LMS, the app distinguishes three different kinds of users: member, staff, and admin with the admin having the highest privilege over the software. The admin user has all the capabilites of the staff users with additional abilities to modify existing users, database, and global policies such as how much fine is charged when a member failed to return a book within time. 

A staff is just an admin with less control over the app. 

### NOTE
The project is an assignment given to the second semester students of the informatics, DSA, and SIB majors of the Petra Christian University. Hence, this project might be discontinued after completion.
